# Phone-usage-for-time-and-power-2-apps-shown-as-an-example-
This is the final project we were asked to do at the end of the semester. I spent about 2 weeks on it altogether. 
I get inputs from the dialogue I designed. Then I will calculate the time and power you used on this app. 
I also create a function called "charging". I will return your remaining power through the given time and charging rate. 
Finally, I will show all these information in 2 separate pie chart.


- What is the business problem you will answer and how you decide what to do 

With the progress of science and technology, we can do more and more things with our phone. 
This makes our life easier, but also may lead to a waste of time and low efficiency at the same time. 
So, I am wondering if there will be an app which could keep track of phone usage, record the usage time of each app on the phone and show it in pie chart. 
In this way, we could know our personal phone usage habits. After knowing this information, we could set goals for ourselves and stay focused on what we are doing.
As well, this could help parents to know the phone usage of their children and discipline them. 

 

- What data was available, and why did you choose the particular one you are using 

Actually, all the data should be reached from the phone automatically, since it is not suitable for this case, I choose to get the data inside a dialogue I designed.  


- What technique you used and why 

I use if-else conditional loop in most of my code, because there are a lot of different circumstances in each function. 
And I use string format while printing out since this will looks clean and easy to change when it is wrong.  

 

- What obstacles you encountered, what you learned, how you fixed it 

The first problem I met is the data. It should be got from the phone directly, but I cannot have it while doing this. 
So, I try to use dialogue to get them as input and process all of them. And the second one is the power level of the phone. 
There is a maximum limit of power, which is 100. In my charging function, it will add up the number depending on the time. 
And I need to make sure that it wonâ€™t go over 100. Also, try to make the speed reasonable.  

 

- What did you find and what are the answers to your business questions? 

I use two applications in this example to simply show the procession. I set the electricity consumption per hour for each application and 
also the increment per hour while charging. After running the class, you will get two graphs which show their percentage and detailed information.  

 

- Future work: how would you continue this work, and what would be follow-up questions if you had more time? 

I think I would add more applications because there are more than two applications on the phone. 
And then, I want to add a timing function like you can only use the application 2 hours today. 
You will decide the time you can use for each app depending on the using habits you got from the pie chart given before.  

 

- Use diagrams/maps/screenshots to illustrate relevant points 

I use two pie charts to show the percentage of usage of time and power of each app. And there are details shown for each part of the pie chart if you put the mouse on it.
